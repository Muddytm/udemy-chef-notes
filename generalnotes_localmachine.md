# IMPORTANT: most chef and chef-client command line stuff is implied to be run as root. Use sudo, or log in as root.


# general

sudo chef-client --local-mode setup.rb (for instance) just runs the code for that machine.

`chef generate` can be used to generate cookbooks, recipes, etc. Type `chef generate` for a list.

docs.chef.io is a good place for resource research.


# cookbook notes

a cookbook defines a scenario, such as everything needed to install and configure MySQL, and then it contains all of the components that are required to support that scenario.

so cookbooks contain not only recipes, but things that the recipes need to function, like configs, etc.

cookbooks specify the resources to use and the order in which they are to be applied.

common components of a cookbook: README, metadata (version, dependencies, etc.), recipes, testing directories (spec + test)

`chef generate cookbook cookbooks/workstation` where cookbooks is the cookbooks directory, to make the cookbook

Berksfile = handles dependencies for cookbooks - we'll see more of this when we work with the chef server

chefignore = like gitignore, used to designate what we wanna ignore

metadata.rb = includes stuff like name, version (important), license, description, etc. We can also store DEPENDENCIES here. You can call other cookbooks from here, which is neat.

README.md = what it says on the tin.

WHEN MAKING COMMITS TO GIT, INCREMENT THE VERSION IN METADATA.RB :)


# chef-client

chef-client is the agent that actually runs stuff.

`chef-client -z --runlist "cookbook::recipe"` ... (i.e. "apache::server")

--runlist = -r

`chef-client -z -r "recipe[apache::server]"` <- syntax for running more than one thing at once

`chef-client -z -r "recipe[apache::server],recipe[cookbook::recipe]"` <- running multiple. No spaces FYI

see default.rb in apache cookbook for info on how to use include_recipe.

`chef-client -z -r "recipe[apache]"` <- shorthand for running default.rb in apache.

`chef-client -z -r "recipe[apache],recipe[cookbook]"` <- Running both defaults back to back

oh yeah, and `-zr` works the same as `-z -r`. :)


# ohai

literally just running `ohai` gets you a BUNCH of system information. It's all in a JSON too.

you can also run stuff like `ohai memory` or `ohai cpu/0/mhz`, which also returns info in JSON.

this is the equivalent of puppet facts! :)

example of using ohai node variables in recipes/setup.rb!

also see server.rb in the apache cookbook for another example.


# templates

these are resources - Embedded Ruby (ERB) templates

the resource is set up as "template" and then calls the ERB as a source

templates will generally replace the "file" resource we've been using.

ERB logic is essentially an if-else statement.

ERB example:

`<% if (50 + 50) == 100 %>

50 + 50 = <%= 50 + 50>

<% else %>

At some point all of MATH I learned in school changed.

<% end %>
`

the teacher of this course likes to remind us that <%= looks like an angry squid. Kinda does.

the angry squid <%= is useful at the beginning of the ERB tags, as it actually posts the following string. see motd.erb in apache templates

check server.rb in apache cookbook for some more info on how to use templates.

you can also pass variables into templates:

`template "/etc/motd" do

  source "motd.erb"

  variables(

  :name => 'Caleb Hawkins'

  )

  action :create

end
`

then in the template, put in `NAME: <%= @name %>` to call this up.


# cookbook_file

cookbook_file = template, but with no variables. it's completely static. example of how to use in a recipe:

`cookbook_file 'file_dir' do

  source 'index.html'

  action :create

end
`

to make one, run `chef generate file cookbooksdir/cookbook/ index.hmtl` (as an example)

format of the file itself is like a template, but it has no variables or anything.


# remote_file

remote_file = a method of getting files from online. in the below example, it's an image.

`remote_file "example/path/file.jpg" do

  source "online_file_source.jpg"

end


template "example/path/index.html" do

  source "index.html.erb"

end

`

index.html.erb then references "file.jpg", and since we've downloaded that via remote_file, it is displayed on the page.


# execute resource

execute resource lets you run other scripts as part of the chef recipe.

there is a bash resource in chef:

`bash "script_name" do

  user "root"

  code "mkdir /var/www/mysites/ && chown -R apache /var/www/mysites"

  not_if "[ -d /var/www/mysites/ ]"

  not_if do

    File.directory?("/var/www/mysites")

  end

  only_if "somethingsomethingsomething (you get the idea)"

end
`

the script function shown above is an example one that creates a directory and sets the owner as "apache" recursively.

you can add "guard" conditions, listed above as not_if and only_if, to specify if the code should be run. doesn't have to be bash, can be ruby, as seen with the second not_if

now for the execute resource:

`execute "run a script" do

  user "root"

  command <<-EOH

  mkdir -p /var/www/mysites/ /

  chown -R apache /var/www/mysites/

  EOH

  not_if blahblahblah

end


execute "run_script" do

  user "root"

  command "./myscript.ssh"

  not_if blahblahblah

end
`

the first option is running a script *in* the recipe, and the second is running the script from its own file.

directory resource:

`directory "/var/www/mysites" do

  owner "apache"

  recursive true

end
`

this does the same thing as the above scripts - creates the directory if it doesn't exist, and then sets the owner as apache recursively if not already done.

this is the preferred way of doing the above function. when possible, use chef resources, and be careful with bash resources.


# users and groups

create a user on a system using a resource:

`user "user1" do

  comment "user1"

  uid 123

  home "/home/user1"

  shell "/bin/bash"

end
`

create a group on a system using a resource:

`group "admins" do

  members "user1" # (OR, members ["user1", "user2", "user3"...])

  append true

end
`

append is used if you want to append the above users to the admin list. leave it out if you want the admin list to be overwritten with the user or users.

a good use of these is to loop over user creation and to add them to a group.


# notifications

notifications are used to notify a resource to take action.

`notifies :action, "resource[name]", :timer

# timer can be :before, :delayed, :immediately

subscribes :action, "resource[name]", timer
`

:before = notify the resource to take action before the resource I'm embedded inside of
:delayed = execute the resource I'm inside of, and then send the notification
:immediately = send the notification ASAP.

example of notifies:

`template "/var/www/html/index.html" do

  source "index.html.erb"

  notifies :restart, "service[httpd]", :immediately

end
`

if index.html changed its state, then restart httpd service RIGHT AWAY.

example of subscribes:

`service "httpd" do

  action [:enable, :start]

  subscribes :restart, "template[/var/www/html/index.html]", :immediately

end
`

this is the same thing, but in a different place. if that template changes, then restart this service RIGHT AWAY.

# debugging, linting, and testing + other bonus content

you can use `chef exec [x]` if [x] does not exist locally, to run it with the chefdk.

`chef exec ruby --help` gives help for ruby stuff. you can run ruby through chef if it does not exist locally

check out `chef shell-init --help` to get info for how to make chef ruby your default ruby, among other things.

if you can't access stuff like `knife`, `chef knife` will work.
